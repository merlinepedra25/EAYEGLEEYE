'ESSID':['ESSID refers to the name of the access point. For example, "Mark\'s Router". If you are curious, ESSID stands for Extended Service Set Identification'],
'MAC':['The MAC address is a unique identifier that distinguishes each computer on a network. Think of it as a unique name for each computer.'],
'AP Channel':['Wi-Fi routers can be set to transmit in different channels. (Think of it as different channels in an FM Radio). If your router uses the 2.4GHz spectrum, there are 11 channels to choose from.','For best Wi-Fi performace, you want to set your router to use a channel that are used by no (or very few) other routers. Also, in general you want to pick 1,6 or 11 as they are the channels with less porbability of interference by other channels.'],
'Clients':['Clients refer to the computers that are connected to the Wi-Fi router. In other words, every computer that is connected to your network is considered a client.'],
'IP Address':['Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses are specific addresses by which each computer can be reached. These address are given to a specific machine when that machine first joins the network. (Thus the IP address can change if the machine leaves and then rejoins the network)'],
'OS':['OS refers to Operating System. The Operating System is the "main" software that your computer runs. Some popular OS are: Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, Linux'],
'Upload Usage':['A client\'s upload usage refers to how much of the network is being used to upload (send information to the internet) things to the internet.'],
'Download Usage':['A client\'s download usage refers to how much of the network is being used to download (recieve information from the internet) things from the internet.'],
'Password Leaks':['When you connect to a website using HTTP (not HTTPS), any information sent to that website will  be visible by other clients on your network. This might be OK within your own network, but you should be aware that if you do this in any public network, you risk getting your password (or any other info you send) stolen.','To know if you are connecting to a website using HTTP, just check to see if you see a small green lock on the left of the address bar on your browser. (or check if the address of the website starts with http:// or https://)'],
'Packets':['Communication among computers on the internet is done by exchanging small messages known as packets.'],
'Sent Packets':['Sent packets refered to the packets that were sent FROM a client computer TO some other computer on the internet (or on the same network)'],
'Recieved Packets':['Recieved packets refered to the packets that were sent TO a client computer FROM some other computer on the internet (or on the same network)'],
'UDP':['UDP is a protocol that controls the transmission of packets. Usually it doesn\'t react to possible congestion in the network, and it tends to share the bandwidth of the network unfairly.','UDP is not commonly used, however you might see video conference programs (e.g. Skype), streaming services, or multiplayer videogames use it.' ],
'TCP':['TCP is a protocol that controls the transmission of packets. It reacts to possible congestion on the network, and it tries to share the bandwidth of the network fairly.','TCP is very commonly used, and you might see it being used for browsing, emailing, and many many other internet-reliant programs.'],
'Ports':['Ports allow different programs within the same computer to connect to the internet simultaneously. In other words, you can have your Internet Browser connect to the internet through port 5512 and your email client connecting through port 1994.','Some ports are commonly used for different applications. For example, to connect to a website you commonly contact the website\'s server at port 80.'],
'HTTP/HTTPS':['HTTP refers to Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, and it is the protocol with which we most commonly connect and interact with websites. HTTPS is the same as HTTP except it uses a secure connection. So if you ever send a password or some other sensitive information, you want to be using HTTPS; Otherwise someone listening on your network might be able to capture that information.'],
'Packet Loss':['Sometimes packets get loss during their transmission. The reasons for a packet loss can vary greatly. However, packet loss on a Wi-Fi network most likely points to poor signal quality due to: 1. Lots of interference on the airwaves, or 2. Poor signal strength.','Common solutions would be: 1. Change your Wi-Fi router\'s channel to a more decongested one, or 2. Move the router closer to your computer.'],
'Throughput':['Throughput refers to the amount of packets passing through the network at a given time. Generally speaking, the greater this number, the more likely you are to see a fast internet interaction.']
